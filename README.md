## General Application Background

The intention of this application if for users to coordinate which trails they will be using for a day hike.

### Constraints:

- Users will go on many hiking trips
- Users will visit one or more trails on a hiking trip
- Users should be allowed to use the same trail on different hiking trips
- Users will only take a hiking trip on a single day (no overnight camping!)


### Do's and Don'ts:

- You will not need to implement authentication/authorization functionality.
- You will be expected to present full test coverage for everything you build.
  - you are ONLY excused from writing validation/relationship tests at the model level
